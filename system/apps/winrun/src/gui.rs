//! Windows with a message loop: a part of `user32` and `gdi32` on top of the
//! arcOS windows of [`arcui`].
//!
//! Each Win32 window is an arcOS window whose canvas keeps what the program
//! drew, as a Windows window does. Mouse, keyboard, resizing and closing come
//! back from arcOS as events and become `WM_*` messages; `GetMessage` merges
//! them with posted messages, timers and `WM_PAINT`. A device context draws
//! with GDI's pen, brush and font onto the window or onto a bitmap (for the
//! usual double buffering with `BitBlt`).
//!
//! Child controls (buttons, edit boxes), menus and dialog resources are not
//! there: a program that builds its whole window from them shows an empty one.

// The Windows structures keep their Windows names.
