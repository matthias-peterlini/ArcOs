//! The Windows API that programs reach through their import table.
//!
//! Every function here follows the Windows x64 calling convention
//! (`extern "win64"`): arguments in RCX, RDX, R8, R9 then the stack, with 32
//! bytes of shadow space. [`resolve`] maps a `(dll, name)` pair to the address
//! of the matching function or variable; the loader writes that address into
//! the program's import address table.
//!
//! The set is small on purpose: the standard streams, the C formatting
//! functions (`vfprintf` and friends), memory, a handful of `kernel32` calls
//! and benign stubs for the rest. It is enough for console programs built with
//! MinGW-w64.
